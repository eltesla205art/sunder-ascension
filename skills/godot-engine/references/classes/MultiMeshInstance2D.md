# MultiMeshInstance2D

**Inherits:** Node2D

Node that instances a MultiMesh in 2D.

MultiMeshInstance2D is a specialized node to instance a MultiMesh resource in 2D. This can be faster to render compared to displaying many Sprite2D nodes with large transparent areas, especially if the nodes take up a lot of space on screen at high viewport resolutions. This is because using a mesh designed to fit the sprites' opaque areas will reduce GPU fill rate utilization (at the cost of increased vertex processing utilization). Usage is the same as MultiMeshInstance3D.

## Properties

- `multimesh: MultiMesh` — The MultiMesh that will be drawn by the MultiMeshInstance2D.
- `texture: Texture2D` — The Texture2D that will be used if using the default CanvasItemMaterial.

## Signals

- `texture_changed()` — Emitted when the `texture` is changed.
