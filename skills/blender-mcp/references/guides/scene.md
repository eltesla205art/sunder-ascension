# Scene design

## Workflow

1. `get_scene_info` — know what's there and the scene's scale before adding anything.
2. Block out with primitives at real-world size: the layout, the big shapes, the camera.
   `look(mode="camera")` or `look(mode="angles")` to check proportions before spending on assets.
3. Replace blockout pieces with real assets, biggest and most visible first.
4. Light, then set materials, then dress with small props.
5. `look` after every meaningful change. Judge the image, not your intentions: is anything
   floating, clipping, the wrong size, or hidden from camera?

## Getting assets

- **Generate** (`generate_3d`) hero objects and anything specific or unusual: "a rusted
  steampunk diving helmet". One object per generation — never a whole scene, the ground, or parts
  to assemble. Generate once and duplicate (`obj.copy()`) for repeats.
- **Poly Haven** (`search_assets(source="polyhaven")`): HDRIs, PBR textures for large surfaces
  (floors, walls, terrain), and generic realistic props. CC0.
- **Sketchfab**: specific real-world things (a named car model, a landmark), and realistic props.
  Check the licence and face count in results.
- **Poly Pizza**: stylised low-poly props, fast and light. Credit CC-BY creators.
- **Script it** only for simple or procedural geometry: walls, floors, shelves, stairs, fences,
  arrays, scattering.

Match the style. Don't mix low-poly Poly Pizza props with photoreal Sketchfab scans in one frame.

## After every import

Imported and generated models arrive at arbitrary scale, rotation and origin. The import result
gives `world_bounding_box`; use it:

- Scale to real size from the bounding box, not by eye.
- Put it on the ground: `obj.location.z -= min_z` (with the bounding box min z).
- Rotate it to face the right way; generators usually face -Y or +Y. Check with
  `look(mode="angles", target=[name])`.
- Check it doesn't intersect its neighbours.

## Composition

- Decide the camera early and compose for it; set `scene.camera`, focal length 35–50 mm for
  natural views, 85 mm+ for product shots, 24 mm or wider for interiors.
- Foreground, midground, background. Leave negative space. Rule of thirds for the subject.
- Vary scale and rotation of repeated props slightly; perfect grids read as fake.
- Ground contact sells realism: props sit on surfaces, small things cluster against larger ones.

## Lighting

- Start with an HDRI from Poly Haven for ambient light and reflections; set its strength
  (0.5–1.5), then add a key light (sun or area) for shape and shadows.
- Three-point for products: key, fill at lower power, rim behind.
- Interiors: area lights in windows (portals in Cycles) plus practicals (lamps with emission).
- Check with `look(mode="camera", shading="rendered")`. Blown-out white or pure black areas mean
  exposure or light power is off; fix light power before touching exposure.

## Render settings

Read the current engine rather than setting one blindly (see `get_guide("bpy")`). For quick
previews keep samples low; raise them only for the final render.
